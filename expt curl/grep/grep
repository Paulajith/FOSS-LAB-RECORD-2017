    GREP – Global Regular Expression Print
 	Searches for text in a file
 	Can search for simple words.
 	Can look for “regular expression”;more complex charecter strings( words followed by any no of spaces, followed by a digit or lowercase 		letter).


	Searching the given string

		     $ grep “literal_string” filename
			To search a specific string in a specified file


	Case insensitive search
	
			        $ grep -i “string” filename
       				 $ grep -i “string” FILE_PATTERN*
				-This searches for given string/pattern case insensitively.


	Simple regular expressions

				“[0-9]” look for any digit



				“[a-zA-Z]” look for one upper or lower case letter	


				“.” look for one charecter
				“.*” any number of charecters
				 “\.” a literal decimal point
				“\.161:” dot, then 161,then colon 
				“\.161[: ]” dot, then 161, then colon or space	


	Advanced regular expressions

				Look for lines that hold either string1 or string2
				$ grep -E ‘(string1|string2)’ filename 
				Lines that have string1 followed by string2 on the same line, but possibly with other charecters in between.
				$ grep ‘string1.*string2’ filename	
				String1 has to be at the beginning of the line.
				$ grep ‘^string1’ filename
				Look for it at the end of the line.
				$ grep ‘string1$’ filename
