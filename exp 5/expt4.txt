Aim : 
*****
		Write shell script to show various system configuration like
			 About your OS and version, release number, kernel version
			 Show all available shells
			 Show mouse settings
			 Show computer CPU information like processor type, speed etc
			 Show hard disk information like size of hard-disk, cache memory, model etc
			 File system (Mounted)




UNIX SHELL :
***********			
		-> traditional unix like commands
		-> command line interpreters

SHELL :		
********
		-> an environment where commands are run
		-> file operation and file permissions are examples

		-> shells        : echo -e "`cat /etc/shells`"
		-> mouse settings: echo -e "`xstq`"	
		-> processor info: echo -e "`cat /proc/meminfo`"
		-> mounted disk  : echo -e "`cat /proc/mounts`"
		-> hard-disk info: hdparm [options] [device ...]

ADVANTAGES :
************
		-> to automate frequency performed operation
		-> easy to use
